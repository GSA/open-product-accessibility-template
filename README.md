# Open Product Accessibility Template (OPAT)

GSA has observed that federal agencies face challenges in delivering accessible services to people with disabilities. Software vendors submit accessibility conformance reports (ACR) for their offerings demonstrating that their products meet Section 508 requirements. However, these ACR documents are a static representation of a product's accessibility snapshot in time rather than evidence of continuous adherence to accessibility requirements which could be validated and tested.  Currently, the government tests these claims, generating validation test results, but the data is not easily findable and thus can often lead to redundant testing and re-work.

This project will develop a digital product accessibility template minimum viable product (MVP) based on Section 508 requirements to enable machine-readable documentation of accessibility conformance and support automated accessibility testing.
