      Drupal doesn't make a strong distinction between the front-end and
      back-end accessibility. Many administration interfaces can be exposed to
      users in a more interactive site. Generally this report focuses the
      Conformance Level / Remarks and Explanations so that Web comments are
      about elements that are typically public for all users, while Authoring
      Tool is typically for authors and administrators. The goal of the
      authoring interface is to support ATAG 2.0 AA (Part A and B). The Drupal
      community strives to keep up with the latest WCAG recommendation.

                The back end of Drupal Core was built to be WCAG 2.1 AA
                compliant and non-text content in the administration interface
                has a textual equivalent. Audio and video can be added to the
                media library, but Core does not provide tools to manage
                transcripts and captions/subtitles for local video and audio.


                Alternative text is required for images by default. [Outstanding
