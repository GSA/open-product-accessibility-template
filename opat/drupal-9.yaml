              notes: The back end of Drupal Core was built to be  WCAG 2.0 AA compliant and non-text content in the administration interface has a textual equivalent. Audio and video can be added to the media library, but Core does not provide tools to manage transcripts and captions/subtitles for local video and audio - Drupal issue 3002770.
