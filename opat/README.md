Current list of example OPATs.

All HTML reports are displayed using the [U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov). That framework is contained in the /opat/uswds/ directory.

The index.html file provides a data table output for the reports. To add a new OPAT file to the data table an entry to the `dataSet` variable will need to be added in the `reports.js`.

See also [OPAT section in CLI documentation](/docs/CLI.md#opats).
